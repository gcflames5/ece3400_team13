## Team Contract, ECE 3400, Fall 2017

By Team 13, September 1st 2017

### ECE 3400, Semester: Fall 2017 Team #13

Team Members: Julia Currie, Nicholas Sarkis, Norman Chen, Eric Cole, Wenhan Xia, and Divya Gupta

#### Team Procedures

It is important to keep all members of the team aware of the time and date of all meetings. It is a good idea to pick a day, time, and place for regular team meetings. Friday 11:15am - 12:05pm

Who will set each agenda? How long before the meeting should this be announced? How will team members be notified/reminded? Who will be responsible for the team following the agenda during a team meeting? What will be done to keep the team on track during a meeting? The team leader for each lab will set the agenda for each meeting.

Agree on how your team will make decisions. By consensus, majority vote, leader has veto rights, etc.? We will try out best to reach a consensus, however if that is not possible we will go by majority vote. Team leader will have tie-breaking powers.

Always keep a written record of what was agreed upon in the meeting. Who will be responsible for taking these notes? How will they be disseminated? Where will all agendas and meeting minutes be kept? This will be done on a rotating basis. Last week's team lead will take meeting minutes.

All members should agree to a preferred method of communication (e.g., e-mail, cell phone, face-to-face), and be individually responsible for answering in good time as agreed upon in the team. Please note what method(s) and response delay you agree on. We will use facebook messenger/email. The response delay will depend on how urgent the matter is.

#### Team Expectations

##### Work Quality

Agree on a (realistic) level of quality for website updates, individual work/design, peer reviews, etc. Great quality! Try your best!!

Agree on when individuals/sub-teams must finish their part (on the deadline, or hours or a day before the deadline such that other team members can check their work): 2 days before the deadline so the whole team can review the work.

Strategies to fulfill these standards: After each lab, the team lead will assign each member as task/section, but the work will mostly be collaborative.

Team Participation:

Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks: Speak up if you need help. If someone is doing a difficult task one week, we will try to lighten up the load next time.

Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members (team maintenance): Everyone will get a chance to talk to the whole group during the team meeting.

Strategies for keeping on task (task maintenance): Use a google sheet to keep track of everyone else's task assignments and their progress.

Strategies to get help if you're stuck: Reach out to the whole group if you have a problem, and the team leader can coordinate how to resolve that issue.

#### Personal Accountability:

Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings: Everyone is expected to be at every meeting, unless you have an unavoidable conflict or valid excuse. Let the group know.

Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines: You are expected complete your task with high quality. If you feel like you can't finish it, inform the group well before the deadline.

Expected level of communication with other team members: Keep the team udpated with your progress, update the google sheet regularly. 

Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks: Full commitment. If you don't think you can meet expectations, let the team know.

How should a team member catch up if they have to miss a meeting: Read the meeting minutes, follow up with the group if you have any questions.

Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations: Bring food/snacks to the meeting.

Describe how, as a group, you would handle individuals who do not live up to this contract: The team leader can bring up the individual during the team meeting.

Describe what your team will do if these infractions continue: Talk to TAs/Kirstin.
