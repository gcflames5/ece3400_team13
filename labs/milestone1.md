# Milestone 1

## Introduction
The main goal of this milestone is to prove the basic functionality of the robot. 

### Hardware
We placed two line sensors right next to each other in the forward center of the chassis and two more sensors placed about 1cm farther out and about 1cm in front of the two center ones. We used this arrangment so that we would be able to continue line sensing while also being able to detect upcoming intersections in the grid. This layout also makes turning easier, because we are able to lock back onto the line much faster.
