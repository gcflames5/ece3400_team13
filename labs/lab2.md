## Optical Team: Assembling the IR Circuit

Members: Nick, Julia, Divya

Objective: Be able to detect a 7kHz IR beacon with an Arduino using the FFT library.

Materials: (link to datasheets)
- Arduino Uno
- IR receiver: LTR-301 (digikey # 160-1065-ND)
  link to IR datasheet: http://optoelectronics.liteon.com/upload/download/DS-50-93-0013/LTR-301.pdf
- 300 Ω resistors
- Treasure board 
- Part number of op-amp???

Preparing treasure (include photo) \
  Output when held treasure at different values (do we have oscilloscope captures?)
  We tuned treasure frequencies to the specific frequencies by hoooking it up to an oscilliscope and adjusting the pot with a screw driver. 

Circuit diagram and explanation
- Phototransistor
- High pass filter (include oscilloscope capture)
 Cutoff frequency, whether affected by fluorscent lights
- Amplifier (include oscilloscope capture)
 Gain, DC offset
 -Include final diagram of our circuit.
